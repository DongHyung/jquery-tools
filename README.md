# JQuery Tools #

JQuery Tools is an attractive set of jQuery plugins for many common tasks. It's extremely well documented, and has some great functionality out of the box.

## About this Fork ##

Since JQuery tools refuses to get their code on Github, I took the liberty of maintaining a version. I'll be making my own bug fixes. Send me a github msg if they release a new version and I forget to update this fork.

Honestly, I think this codebase is a jQuery coding disaster. The author has very little understanding of jQuery custom event mechanism, and decides to implement his own inner api object within each plugin. Makes it very hard to hack. 

Eventually, I'd like to turn this fork into a "proper" implementation of these plugins. Would love any help on this, so please fork this repo and submit patches.
